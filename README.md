Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The goal of the app I developed was to help users set a goal weight they want to reach and track their progress towards reaching that goal. It needed to have a user-friendly interface that visualized their weight data in a simple format. It also needed to make use of SMS features to notify users when they reached their goal. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The different kinds of screens this app needed include:
Login Screen: Screen to create an account and log in when starting the app
Home Screen: Main screen users see after logging in allowing the user to navigate around the app as well as displaying all the logged weights
Setting Screen: Screen allowing user to adjust app settings like turning SMS notifications on and off, or deleting their account
Weight Entry Screen: Screen allowing users to enter data including the date and weight on that date
Data Edit Screen: Screen allowing users to edit their entered data as well as setting their goal weight

I kept my users in mind by trying to offer a clean, legible, simple UI for navigating the app and I feel while I was successful in accomplishing that goal, there is always room for improvement.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

The way I approached coding this app was by breaking down each screen into a seperate step that needed to be worked on. This allowed me to focus on the tasks individually and be able to think about how the different classes would interact with eachother. I did struggle quite a bit with this project so being able to work in a modular way allowed me to get through the project. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

The way I was able to test my code to make sure it was functional was by using the emulator built in to the Android Studio IDE.
It was very useful to be able top launch it and see what was working and what was giving me errors in the IDE logcat. 

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

I don't know if I can name a specific area where I was able to innovate to overcome all the challenges I faced in this app design process. It took a lot of referencing the course material, Googling about questions I had, and a lot of trial and error to get through this project. 

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

The parts of my app I feel I was particularly successful was in the format and legibitlity of my code. I was also really happy with the UI and theme of the app.
